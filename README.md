# 👋 Hi, I'm Tumeth97 – Hardware Design Engineer

I design and ship production-ready hardware systems.  
From schematic to bring-up, power architecture to signal integrity — I care about building things that work, scale, and ship.

This repo is a personal archive of my hardware design work.  
It will include:

- 📁 **Board design projects** – schematic, layout, PDN, SI/PI insights  
- 🧠 **Bring-up logs** – notes from real debugging under pressure  
- 🛠️ **Tools & checklists** – internal frameworks I use to design, review, and validate  
- 🧪 **Failure stories** – and how I fixed them

> ⚠️ I'm currently curating and cleaning up past designs.  
Projects will be uploaded and documented gradually — follow this repo to see updates.
